I enjoy all kinds of movies, especially action and fantasy.
Action movies are fun and exciting because they are full of adventure. 
The stories are interesting, and the actors are strong and dynamic. 
Sometimes, I also watch fantasy movies with my family. 
Watching them helps me relax and have a great time.

Last week, I remember watching a movie with my family at the cinema.
It took about 5 minutes to get there from my house.
Before watching the movie, I prepared some snack and drinks.
When we arrived, we bought the tickets.
The movie was amazing because it had beautiful scenes.
After watching the movie, we went out for some food and talked about the actor in the movie.

Last week, I remember watching a movie with my family at the cinema.
It took about 5 minutes to get there from my house.
I watched a movie called Titanic.
It is a love story on the big ship.
The main characters meet on the ship and fall in love.
The movie is special because it has beautiful scenes.
The music is also very nice.
Looking back, I found this movie interesting.
